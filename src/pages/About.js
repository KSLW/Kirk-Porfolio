        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I’m <strong>Kirk Wilkinson</strong> — a self-taught full-stack developer who builds clean, reliable,
          and human-centered software using the <strong>MERN</strong> and <strong>PERN</strong> stacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          My background isn’t the usual one — I started my career as a chef, where I learned precision, timing,
          and how to stay calm under pressure. Eventually, I realized the part I loved most was the <em>creative problem solving</em> —
          and I found that same spark in coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I channel that energy into crafting intuitive interfaces and modular backends. Whether it’s automating workflows,
          integrating APIs, or improving user experience, I focus on making tech feel effortless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of code, I run <strong>LogicallySleepy</strong> — a growing Twitch and Discord community where I experiment
          with interactive bots, overlays, and automation tools like <strong>Obsidian</strong>.
